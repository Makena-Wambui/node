Node js is not a language like JavaScript or a framework like Express or a library like React.

Rather it is an open source javascript runtime.

A runtime is a program or an environment that runs other programs.
So we can build JS applications and run them on your computer or on the server.

Built with C++
Uses the powerful V8 javascript engine that was developed by Google for Chrome browser and is known for its speed and performance.

Mostly used to develop server side or networking applications/apis/microservices
Allows you to use Js To write server side code

Traditionally JS was only used in the client side on the web browser for things like form validation, animation etc.
With Node js we are able to take Javascript out of the browser so that JS becomes a full stack language.

Other JS runtimes include Bun js and Deno js but these are relatively new and not as widely adopted as Node js.

Node js is fast, lightweight and efficient and scalable due to its architecture and V8 engine.
Pretty popular - alot of websites and applications use it.
Really large companies like Uber, Netflix, LinkedIn, Walmart, eBay, PayPal, Trello, Medium, NASA, Microsoft, IBM, and many more use Node js.
Also a popular option for startups and small projects too
